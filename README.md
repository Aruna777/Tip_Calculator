welcome note:

I created a tip calculator with bill splitting technique for number of people in the table. The Bill Splitter page for the total bill amount, tip percentage, and the number of people. Then it displays the tip and the total amount (including the tip) each person has to pay out of that bill.

Here I have created the business logic per our design model in order to be shared across all platforms, and implemented several VM properties: bill total, number of people, tip amount, total amount, total per person in the project. Also, Built an API to record and implemented VM properties are MVVM-ready properties that is backed with fields, and each time the value is set, ‘OnPropertyChanged’ event is called.

SCREENSHOTS:

TOTAL CHECK AMOUNT 12 DOLLARS IS BEEN SPLIT TO 3 PERSON WITH 10% TIP TOTAL :
